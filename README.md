### Few notes about my solution:
- Task said that script must accept file, but since file can be read using different approaches and CSV.foreach is much more memory efficient. I decided to use path to file
- Task said nothing about format of input data but examples shown me formats without protocol so I assume that all sites would be without protocol
- Most of modern sites uses https, and nothing about it have been said in the task. I will use https protocol by default

### How to use
Just run `ruby runner.rb`


P.S. If it was my real working task I would reach @roman_kovtunenko and clarify all the points, but it's just a small test task and I don't want to detract him from work
